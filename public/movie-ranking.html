    <li><h3>3 idiots</h3></li>
<p>
    In college, Farhan and Raju form a great bond with Rancho due to his positive and refreshing outlook to life. Years later, a bet gives them a chance to look for their long-lost friend whose existence seems rather elusive.
</p>
<li><h3>12th Fail</h3></li>
<p>Bold, Raw, Unfiltered, Real.A movie that definitely breaks the typecasting of Bollywood movies from the ongoing load of commerical, overhyped, overmarketed movies coming out of the movie factory, that is Bollywood. Depicts a real life story of an UPSC aspirant (and the likes), the struggles year after year, the battle of resilience, and at last the judgement day.</p>
<li><h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3></li>
<p>"Seize the day", is the whole and soul of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I was actually quite low on expectations with this movie. But this movie has turned out to be a vagabond of friendship, love, adventure, emotions and above all, LIFE.Overall, this road movie is a trip to remember.</p>
